7. Reproduce DeFi hack incidents with the [DeFiHackLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiHackLabs) repository
8. Do at least 2-3 shadow audits (redo past contests, which already have final reports out), examples are [BeedleFi](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clkbo1fa20009jr08nyyf9wbx), [Asymmetry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry), [Curve](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-curves), [DYAD](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-04-dyad), [Revolution Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol) and also participate in [First Flights](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights) by [Cyfrin](https://www.cyfrin.io)
9. Learn bugs while reading reports from previous audits in [Solodit](https://solodit.xyz/)

Now you should be ready to participate in live contests on audit platforms like [Code4rena](https://www.code4rena.com), [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/), [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com), [Cantina](https://www.cantina.xyz), [HatsFinance](https://app.hats.finance) and [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/). Before participating in a public contest, be sure to read the documentation of the audit platform that organizes it!
