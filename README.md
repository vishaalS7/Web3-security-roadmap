# The Ultimate Web3 Security Researcher Roadmap
An updated (by 2024) roadmap to help you become a successful Web3 security researcher with [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)

1. [Read](https://cypherpunks-core.github.io/ethereumbook) the Mastering Ethereum book.
2. Watch all of the playlists by [Smart Contract Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/@smartcontractprogrammer) **or** complete all of the courses on [Cyfrin Updraft](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/).
3. Watch [Owen Thurm](https://www.youtube.com/@0xOwenThurm) on YouTube - ([Web3 Security 101 playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIoozgIl4pw&list=PLTJasqY2MI_8XWRY3Ovw39DEkunIyPJUt) and then [Advanced Web3 Security Course Part 1 & Part 2](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWdUkQu4ts19wkfWmoT7NkB2l3M03P1r3&si=NX1Divi1Jukhnmjg)).
4. Exercise most common smart contract vulnerabilities using Foundry with the [DeFiVulnLabs](https://github.com/SunWeb3Sec/DeFiVulnLabs) repository.
5. Do [shadow audits](https://x.com/xb0g0/status/1791716298918965401) on these past contests - [BeedleFi](https://www.codehawks.com/contests/clkbo1fa20009jr08nyyf9wbx), [Asymmetry](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-03-asymmetry), [Curves](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-01-curves), [Revolution Protocol](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-12-revolutionprotocol) and also you can participate in [First Flights](https://www.codehawks.com/first-flights).
6. Learn bugs while reading reports from previous audits in [Solodit](https://solodit.xyz/).

Now you should be ready and well-prepared to participate in live contests on audit platforms like [Code4rena](https://www.code4rena.com), [Sherlock](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/), [CodeHawks](https://www.codehawks.com), [Cantina](https://www.cantina.xyz), [HatsFinance](https://app.hats.finance) and [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/bug-bounty/).
